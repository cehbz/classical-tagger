**Estimated effort:** 10 minutes (Option A) to 4 hours (Option D)

### 2. Add HTML Parsing Library for Web Scraping ⚠️
**Status:** Framework complete, needs HTML parsing

### Scraper Implementation Template

For each new scraper, follow this pattern:

```go
// internal/scraping/sitename.go
package scraping

type SiteNameExtractor struct {
    client *http.Client
}

func NewSiteNameExtractor() *SiteNameExtractor {
    return &SiteNameExtractor{
        client: &http.Client{Timeout: 30 * time.Second},
    }
}

func (e *SiteNameExtractor) Name() string {
    return "Site Name"
}

func (e *SiteNameExtractor) CanHandle(url string) bool {
    return strings.Contains(url, "sitename.com")
}

func (e *SiteNameExtractor) Extract(url string) (*domain.Album, error) {
    // 1. Fetch HTML
    // 2. Parse with goquery
    // 3. Extract fields
    // 4. Return domain.Album
}
```

## Metadata Source Priority

Based on the Classical Music Guide, implement scrapers in this order:

1. **Classical Archives** (mentioned first, most comprehensive)
2. **Naxos** (large catalog, well-structured)
3. **ArkivMusic** (comprehensive metadata)
4. **Presto Classical** (good for recent releases)
5. **Harmonia Mundi** (already started, label-specific)

## Estimated Total Effort

| Priority | Tasks | Est. Hours |
|----------|-------|------------|
| High | 2 items | 2-5 hours |
| Medium | 5 scrapers | 10-15 hours |
| Important | 5 items | 12-18 hours |
| Nice to Have | 9 items | 50+ hours |
| **Total** | **21 items** | **74-88+ hours** |

## Quick Wins (Do First)

1. ✅ Add metaflac integration (10 min)
2. ✅ Complete Harmonia Mundi HTML parsing (1-2 hours)
3. ✅ Add goquery library (5 min)
4. ✅ Implement Classical Archives scraper (2-3 hours)
5. ✅ Enhanced artist parsing (2-3 hours)

**Total Quick Wins:** ~6-9 hours to get to fully functional state

## Current Status Summary

| Component | Status | Next Step |
|-----------|--------|-----------|
| Domain Model | ✅ Complete | - |
| Validation | ✅ Complete | Add title case validation |
| Tag Reading | ✅ Complete | Enhance artist parsing |
| Tag Writing | ⚠️ 95% | Add FLAC library |
| Filesystem | ✅ Complete | - |
| Storage | ✅ Complete | - |
| Scraping Framework | ✅ Complete | Implement HTML parsing |
| Harmonia Mundi | ⚠️ 80% | Complete HTML parsing |
| Other Scrapers | ⏸️ Not Started | Implement 4 additional sources |
| Validate CLI | ✅ Complete | - |
| Tag CLI | ⚠️ 95% | Add FLAC library |
| Extract CLI | ⚠️ 90% | Complete HTML parsing |

## Notes

- All framework code is complete and tested
- Two libraries needed for full functionality (FLAC writing, HTML parsing)
- Five additional scrapers requested based on Classical Music Guide
- Project is ~80% complete, ~20 hours from production-ready
- Additional scrapers add ~10-15 hours

## Getting Started

To continue development:

```bash
# 1. Add libraries
go get github.com/PuerkitoBio/goquery

# 2. Implement metaflac integration (10 min)
# Edit internal/tagging/writer.go

# 3. Complete Harmonia Mundi scraper (1-2 hours)  
# Edit internal/scraping/harmoniamund.go

# 4. Add first new scraper - Classical Archives (2-3 hours)
# Create internal/scraping/classicalarchives.go

# 5. Test everything
go test ./...
```

## Blockers

- None currently
- All dependencies are available
- All tools are working
- Framework is complete

**Status:** Ready for implementation
**Next Milestone:** Complete 5 metadata source scrapers

---
## Missing consistency checks that should be added:

- Disc number consistency: Compare disc number from tag against disc number extracted from directory path (CD1/, CD2/, etc.)
- Album title vs directory name: No validation that album title tag matches the parsed directory name (currently only used as fallback, not validated)
- Track title tag vs filename title mismatch severity: Currently treats all mismatches as errors, but minor differences (typos, abbreviations) could be warnings
- File extension validation: No check that Track.Name ends with .flac
- Track number format in tag vs filename: The tag might have track 3 while filename has 03 - this is acceptable, but not explicitly validated for consistency

## inter-track consistency issues that the rules mandate but your current validation doesn't fully cover.

- Rule_2_3_15_disc_numbering_scheme_consistency: Validate that multi-disc albums use ONE consistent approach (subdirs, successive, or prefix)
- Rule_2_3_15_successive_numbering: If using single directory for multi-disc, validate track numbers are actually successive
- Album-level file extension consistency: All tracks should use same format (.flac)
- Disc tag vs directory structure consistency: If tracks have disc tags > 1, validate matching CD1/, CD2/ subdirectories exist (or vice versa)

---

currently the rule file names, file comments, and RuleMedata are not always consistent with the rules as laid out in the Rules and Guides folder.

Please re-read the files in "Rules and Guides" and update the filenames, comments, and RuleMetadata so that they match the rules they're actually implementing.

split TagAccuracyVsReference into AlbumTagAccuracy and TrackTagAccuracy rules

---

The album/track rule finder should not disallow duplicate names if the signatures are different. The requirement that the rule ID be unique is probably correct though.
