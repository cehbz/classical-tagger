## What It Checks

### Directory Structure
- Path length (180 character limit)
- Leading spaces in paths
- Multi-disc organization (CD1, CD2, etc.)
- Folder naming conventions

### Metadata
- Required tags: Composer, Artist, Album, Title, Track Number
- Composer NOT in track title
- Artist format validation
- Track number format
- Album completeness

### File Names
- Track number format (01, 02, etc.)
- File extension (.flac)
- Character encoding

## Dependencies

- `github.com/dhowden/tag` - FLAC tag reading
- `github.com/cehbz/classical-tagger/internal/domain`
- `github.com/cehbz/classical-tagger/internal/validation`
- `github.com/cehbz/classical-tagger/internal/filesystem`
- `github.com/cehbz/classical-tagger/internal/tagging`

## Testing

```bash
go test ./cmd/validate -v
```

## Integration with CI/CD

```bash
# Exit code can be used in scripts
if ./validate "/path/to/album"; then
    echo "Album is valid"
else
    echo "Album has errors"
    exit 1
fi
```

## Known Limitations

1. **Artist parsing**: Currently treats entire Artist tag as ensemble
   - TODO: Parse "Soloist, Ensemble, Conductor" format
2. **Arranger detection**: "(arr. by X)" not auto-parsed yet
3. **Title case**: Capitalization not validated yet
4. **Movement format**: Opus/movement numbers not validated yet

## Future Enhancements

- [ ] JSON output format for automation
- [ ] Batch validation of multiple directories
- [ ] Configurable rule severity levels
- [ ] Auto-fix suggestions
- [ ] Integration with `tag` command for fixes
